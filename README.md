# DockerML
Contains my explorations of using Docker to automate ML workflows.

The directories contain scripts necessary in order build and run Docker images locally but they can be extended as needed. The directories are organized in increasing order of complexity. 

**Disclaimer**
The materials presented in this repository are just sort of my homeworks as I make progress toward learning the beautiful subject of MLOps. 

I am following [this course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-end-to-end-machine-learning-workflows-kubeflow/) primarily in order to learn MLOps. 

## Setup
In order to run this demo one needs to have Docker set up. Follow [this documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to set it up. Demo-wise instructions are available in the respective directories.
